## Introduction

_Space_—the final frontier. For centuries, humans have gazed at the stars and **dreamed** of exploring the cosmos. This guide will take you through some fascinating aspects of space exploration.

```ts
// Constants, variables, and type annotations
const PI: number = 3.14159;
let radius: number = 10;

// Enum
enum Color {
  Red = "RED",
  Green = "GREEN",
  Blue = "BLUE",
}

// Interface
interface Shape {
  name: string;
  area: () => number;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Gravity

_Gravity_ is the force that holds planets in orbit around stars. Without it, the universe as we know it would not exist.

### Black Holes

Black holes are regions of space where **gravity** is so strong that not even light can escape. Black holes are regions of space where **gravity** is so strong that not even light can escape.

> "A black hole is where God divided by zero." — Steven Wright

Lack holes are regions of space where **gravity** is so strong that not even light can escape.

### Spacecraft

`Spacecraft` are vehicles designed for travel or operation in outer space. Here’s a simple representation in code:

```python
def launch():
    print("Ignition! Launching spacecraft...")
```

## The Solar System

| Planet  | Diameter (km) | Moons |
| ------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Mercury | 4,880         | 0     |
| Venus   | 12,104        | 0     |
| Earth   | 12,742        | 1     |
| Mars    | 6,779         | 2     |

## Fun Facts

- Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus?
- The **Sun** accounts for _99.86%_ of the mass in the solar system.
- There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth.
